### The Claim:

The Bible gives President Trump the moral authority to use whatever force necessary, including assassination or even war, to take out an evildoer.  This claim was made by Robert Jeffress in the Washington Post on August 8, 2017.

### Is it Biblical?

This claim is **unbiblical**, but only because it includes the word "moral," which strongly implies righteousness.

While Romans 13:1 instructs "every soul be subject unto the higher powers" and affirms that "the powers that be are ordained of God," not all leaders are righteous.  1 Peter 2:18 restates the instruction to "be subject to your masters with all fear," but it further clarifies, "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward."  If you're unfamiliar with the word "froward," here's a fine definition:

*froward* (adj.): contrary and intractable like Trump on a Twitter rampage.

1 Peter 2:18 juxtaposes "froward" against "good and gentle" to draw out a contrast, meaning that a froward leader is a far cry from righteous.  Indeed, while God ordained the authority of pagan dictators like Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus, and guided their paths in order to bring about His greater plan of redemption, their God-given authority did not credit to them any amount of righteousness; not because of their wicked hearts or evil deeds, but because they lacked the sort of faith described in Hebrews 11 -- which is the same faith given by grace to all believers in Jesus Christ.

"As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one" (Romans 3:10).

No matter where you fit yourself within the political spectrum -- from Trump to Hillary, from Roy Moore to Bernie Sanders, from Ronald Reagan to Che Guevara -- God's judgment of your moral worth is the same: without Jesus Christ, you're a sinner on your way to destruction.  What could a wretched enemy of God possibly offer to save his soul from the punishment he rightfully deserves?  The prophet Isaiah laments, in chapter 64 and verse 6, "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags."

We wonder if Jeffress and other politically-conservative evangelicals would confess that Obama was also ordained by God to institute the Affordable Care Act and to appoint Supreme Court justices who would rule in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages.  We don't dispute this fact, which is the clear teaching in Romans 13 and 1 Peter 2, but we can only do this because we also understand that any such office of leadership imputes no "moral authority" whatsoever.

### Note:

Jeffress concluded his statement on Fox News by saying, "And I think most Christians understand this [idea of using force to topple evil]," but by the time he made another appearance, he had modified his assessment of Christian agreement: "There is a great deal of confusion among Christians when it comes to this idea of using force to topple evil."

It would appear that Jeffress was confused about the state of Christian agreement on this subject.

On this topic, PolitiFact says, "Whether the Bible gives a president moral authority is subjective, however, so this is not a statement we can rate.  When we asked scholars from several disciplines about Jeffressâ€™ interpretation, we found differences of opinion."

At BibleFact, we believe that the Bible alone reveals objective truth, including a coherent system of moral absolutes, so unlike PolitiFact's timid appeal to moral subjectivity and academic opinion, we can boldly rate this statement according to what the Bible says.

Anyone who argues that confusion and disagreement among men over Bible interpretation impugns biblical authority must also admit that the continuing confusion and disagreement over political issues impugns PolitiFact's journalistic methodology of asserting "facts" based on citation of sources.  Put this way, we think PolitiFact would agree that controversy over any issue is no excuse for shrugging our shoulders and giving up on reason.  Differences of opinion indicate confusion among people, which is an unavoidable fact of life, but with God there is no confusion, and He has blessed us with His infallible word in scripture in order to bring light into the world.
