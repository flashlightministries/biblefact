A vulgarity-laced video shot by phone in a Seattle coffee shop is making the rounds, and it has many Christians crying foul.  On the heels of a recent Washington State Supreme Court decision against a Christian florist who turned away business providing flowers for a same-sex wedding ceremony, and in view of an upcoming hearing by the Supreme Court of the United States to consider a similar case brought by the ACLU against a Christian cake baker, some Christians are calling for a retaliatory lawsuit to be filed against this gay coffee shop owner.  The claim is that policies protecting groups from discrimination based on sexual orientation ought to work both ways, so Christians should fight in court for similar legal protection as a faith-based group.

### Is it Biblical?

Suing a business for illegal discrimination is not in itself unbiblical, but it's important to consider the real motivation behind such a lawsuit.  Is it for actual protection from discrimination, or for striking back in anger to a perceived wrongdoing?  Our legal system exists to provide the first kind of protection, but it is God's job alone to render justice of the latter sort.

"I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings" (Jer 17:10).

"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord" (Rom 12:19).

Jesus tells His followers to love our enemies and turn the other cheek (Matthew 5:38-48).  These aren't just platitudes, but commandments from God.

Secondarily, we must ask if forcing businesses to serve everyone is fair in the first place.  The gay coffee shop owner explained that he was offended by the literature the Christians had been distributing outside, in public, which graphically described abortion as murder and condemned the sin of homosexuality.

The gospel itself is offensive to the unbeliever (1 Peter 2:8), and when it comes to a business owner who takes offense at the cross, he or she ought to be legally allowed to refuse service for that reason.  Everyone is free to accept the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ or to deny that gift and face the consequences

The Christians who were kicked out of the coffee shop said they did not want to see the coffee shop owner unfairly treated, as many Christian business owners have been.  One of them elaborated, "On the contrary, my whole thought, even after, was that I hope that they continue to think about the literature, and it convicts them to the point of repentance."

Now **that's** biblical.
