description: All the news that's fit for teaching, for reproof, for correction and for training in righteousness.

We report the news from a strictly biblical point of view.  Like the psalmist says when praising God, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path" (Psa 119:105).  The Bible always reveals God's truth surrounding current events because nothing of the world has changed since biblical times: what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun (Ecc 1:9).  Each of our articles pivots around a key Bible passage for exposition of God's Word as it relates to worldly news, and concludes with an uplifting message suitable for teaching and inspiration.

As the Holy Spirit dwells within believers and illuminates the Word of God, we hope **BIBLE NEWS FLASH** will help to shed His light on the news and help us discern between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error (Jn 14:26; 1Jn 4:6).

By grace alone Jesus Christ saves the elect by their faith alone, and even more than that, He has risen and ever lives to intercede for us (Eph 2:8-9; Rom 11:5-6; Rom 8:34).  We put all our trust in the perfect wisdom of God, who is immutable and whose laws do not change (Prv 3:5-8; Jam 1:5; Mal 3:6; Psa 33:11; Heb 13:8; Jam 1:17).  God is good and can be trusted, His judgment is perfect, and He always works out His plan everywhere in the world and in our lives (Num 23:19; Php 1:6; Tit 1:2; Dt 32:4; Jer 29:11, 1:5; Prv 16:9; Eph 2:10).

All that we do, we do for God's glory (Rom 11:36; 1Co 10:31; Jn 11:40).  We serve humbly and rejoice as ambassadors for Christ, who is God, ascribing all truth authority to the clear and inerrant Holy Scriptures alone (2Co 5:20; 1Pe 5:6-8; 1Cor 4:6; Dt 29:29; 2Ti 3:15-16; Ac 17:11; Mat 5:18).

In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray for guidance and strength in these trying times, and we light a lamp to shine before all men that we may glorify our Father who is in heaven (Php 4:4-7; Mat 5:14-16).
